                <p>As Colorado’s second-most populous and largest city in the state by acreage, there’s a lot in Colorado Springs that 
                    I've enjoyed. The Olympic City is famous for everything from its iconic Pikes Peak to the 
                    giant mix of reddish-white sandstones and limestone that jut up from the ground. If you’re curious about the features that 
                    define this growing Front Range Colorado city, read on. In the minds of many athletes and sports fans around the world, 
                    Colorado Springs is inextricably linked with the Olympics and Paralympics. Comprised of two campuses on which Olympic 
                    and Paralympic athletes train, the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Training Center’s Colorado Springs location was chosen for 
                    the area’s high elevation, an important training asset that provides a significant advantage for some athletes. A 
                    registered National Natural Landmark, Garden of the Gods is a stunning collection of 300-foot monolithic red rock 
                    formations that explode up towards the sky set against the majestic Pikes Peak in the background. If you’re curious 
                    about how this fascinating landscape was formed, the Garden of the Gods Visitor & Nature Center features terrific interactive exhibits.

                            For those who may be wondering what are Rocky Mountain Oysters: they are ‘world famous’ oysters of bull, bison, or calf 
                            testicles in Colorado (I must confess, I've NEVER tried them). In case you were wondering, the dish was not invented in 
                            the mountains, however, but rather on the ranches. The testicles are first stripped of it's outer membrane and are then sliced. 
                            The slices are mixed with cornmeal or any other flour and are further deep fried. The dish is then dipped in cocktail sauce and 
                            makes a brilliant appetizer.
